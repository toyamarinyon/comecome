Built WebSite with Astro allows you to highlight your code blocks with no configuration, But it cannot highlight a specific line.

If you use the Integration API Astro provided, you can modify markdown processes, but it is a bit too complex.

This post will show you how to highlight a line on your code block with `rehype-pretty-code`.

<Callout label="tip">
  Astro documentation site is a very good example of cutom highlighting using the Integration API, and I encourage anyone interested to take a look.

  <NewTabLink href="https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/14379968fe4694075d259cc8fc9b661769c7ad78/astro.config.ts#L32">
    Open on GitHub
  </NewTabLink>

  It can highlight diff in the code block like that:

# Start with mdx-template

Astro provides a template for mdx, and you can try it on StackBlitz, so let's start with it.

<NewTabLink href="https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/with-mdx">
  ![Open in
  StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)
</NewTabLink>

If you open the above template on StackBlitz, you can see the following:

This page will eventually look like this:

# Install Rehype Pretty Code

First, install Rehype Pretty Code with npm. Stop the dev server and run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev rehype-pretty-code
```

## What's Rehype Pretty Code?

Rehype Pretty Code is a Rehype plugin that provides beautiful code blocks for your MD/MDX docs. It has advantages over other solutions such as Prism.

You will disable syntax highlighting with Astro's built-in syntax highlighting, and use Rehype Pretty Code instead.

## Add rehype-pretty-code to Astro config

Open `astro.config.mjs` and add the following code:

```js showLineNumbers {4-26, 31-35} title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
import preact from "@astrojs/preact";
import rehypePrettyCode from "rehype-pretty-code";

const prettyCodeOptions = {
  theme: "solarized-dark",
  onVisitLine(node) {
    if (node.children.length === 0) {
      node.children = [
        {
          type: "text",
          value: " ",
        },
      ];
    }
  },
  onVisitHighlightedLine(node) {
    node.properties.className.push("highlighted");
  },
  onVisitHighlightedWord(node) {
    node.properties.className = ["word"];
  },
  tokensMap: {},
};

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx(), preact()],
  markdown: {
    extendDefaultPlugins: true,
    syntaxHighlight: false,
    rehypePlugins: [[rehypePrettyCode, prettyCodeOptions]],
  },
});
```

On line 32, you've disabled syntax highlighting with Astro's built-in. And on line 33, you've added Rehype Pretty Code to the rehypePlugins.

Now, you can start the dev server and see the result:

# Add meta string to your code block

Rehype pretty format provides a way to highlight a specific line, but you need to add a meta string to your code block.

Open `src/pages/index.mdx` and add meta string `{1-3}` to code block.

```mdx showLineNumbers{23} /{1-3}/ title="src/pages/index.mdx"
```astro {1-3}
```

You can see the lines 1 to 3 are added `highlighted` css class if you insepect code block.

<Callout label="note">
Rehype Pretty Code also provides another meta string to highlight a specific word or show line numbers. See the <NewTabLink href="https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/">Rehype Pretty Code website</NewTabLink> for more information.
</Callout>

## Add style to the highlighted line

You've already added a css class to the lines you want to highlight. Let's add style to it.

First, create a layout to add `<style>` tag. Create `src/components/Layout.astro` and add the following code:

```astro title="src/components/Layout.astro"
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <slot />
    <style is:global>
      div[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] { background-color: #111;}
      pre > code {
        display: grid;
        background-color: rgba(200, 200, 255, .09);
      }
      .highlighted {
        background-color: rgba(200,200,255,.1);
        border-left-color: #60a5fa;
        border-left-width: 3px;
        border-left-style: solid;
      }
    </style>
  </body>
</html>
```

And open `src/pages/index.mdx`, and set this layout using `layout frontmatter`.

```mdx showLineNumbers {1-3} title="src/pages/index.mdx"
---
layout: ../components/Layout.astro
---
import Counter from '../components/Counter.jsx';
import Title from '../components/Title.astro';
export const components = { h1: Title };

```

Now, you can see the highlighted line!
